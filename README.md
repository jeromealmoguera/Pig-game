# Pig Game

Pig Game is also part of the simple JavaSript project I am learning from a course. This project is designed to familiarize myself with DOM manipulation, specifically using its commonly used methods as well as how functions work. Additionally, for me to get used to applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle on my codes to avoid redundancy and maximize the reusability of my codes.

## About the game

The "Pig Game" is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points.

Game Mechanics:

1. Turn: On each turn, a player rolls a die.
2. Point accumulation: If the player rolls a number between 2 and 6, they add that number to their running total for that turn.
3. Pig out: But if the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn and their turn ends.
4. Hold: The player can choose to "hold" at any time, keeping the points they've accumulated during that turn and ending their turn.
5. Winning: The first player to reach 100 points wins.

Itâ€™s a game of risk management, where you can accumulate more points by continuing to roll, but if you keep rolling and hit a 1, you lose all points for that turn.
